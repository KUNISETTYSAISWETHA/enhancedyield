Crop yield prediction plays a pivotal role in ensuring food security, optimizing agricultural practices and managing natural resources effectively
This project helps farmers to select which will give more yield using ML algorithms like regression models, decision tree, mean squared error and ensemble method to forecast crop yield. 
Machine Learning which is a branch of AI focusing on learning , is a practical approach that can provide better yield prediction based on several features.
The dataset used in this project is crop_yield.csv. The dataset contains information about Crop Year, Area, Estimated yield, Fertilizer, Pesticide, Annual rainfall, Name of the crop and 
the state.

**Data Preprocessing Tools:** Software tools like Pandas, NumPy, and scikit-learn are used for data cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
**Python Libraries:** Libraries like seaborn, numpy, pandas, matplotlib are commonly used to build and train ML models.
**Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):** IDEs like Jupyter Notebook, PyCharm are used for coding, experimentation, and model development.

The ML code is written in Jupyter notebook and the html code in Pycharm Community Edition.
We have predicted the yield using **Decision Trees**.
Yield is calculated in terms of tonnes.
